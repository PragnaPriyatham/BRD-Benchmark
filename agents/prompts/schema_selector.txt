"As a professional database administrator, your task is to analyze the user's question and identify the most relevant database schema from a list of available databases. 
Based on the user's question, you must determine which database schema is most appropriate.

Instructions:
Carefully read the user's question.
Cross-reference the user's query with the schemas in DB_list.
For each schema, consider if the question pertains to that schema based on the subject matter, such as location, entity type, or data domain.
Return a list of the most relevant database that would help answer the userâ€™s query.

Input:
User Question: {user_question}
DB List: {db_list}


Example:
    [Input]
        User Question: "What is the average school rating in California?"
        DB List: ['california_schools', 'new_york_schools', 'texas_schools']
    [Expected Output] 
        ['california_schools']
    

Key Considerations:
Pay attention to the domain of the question (e.g., schools, cities, loans, etc.).
Focus on relevant keywords like location or entity type (e.g., California for schools).
Ensure that the returned schemas are the best fit based on the user's query.
